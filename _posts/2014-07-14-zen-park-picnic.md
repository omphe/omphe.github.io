I hit the park this afternoon for lunch.  Was preoccupied as usual.  Thinking about work.  About all the opportunities I might be giving up by moving on. By pursuing new goals and adventures.  Whether I was destroying the ambitions I had.  Was I being a fool?

I noticed the beautiful, warm sun.  And the grass and the perfect afternoon.  And I thought about how 40 summers have passed in my life.  40 perfect warm picnic moments and that here I was.

And I looked at my hands and thought about what a miracle my body is.  What an unlikely collection of chemistry and atoms and collaborating cells and here I was.  Me.

Suddenly my eating slowed down.  My mind calmed.  My heart slowed and I noticed that I had stopped shovelling my food in.  I was slowly, sloth-like pulling the carrots and rice to my mouth.  That the flavours of the vegetables were more vibrant. Colours.

Everything slowed.  I just was. It was good.  Life is good.

I am only a fool when I move too fast.
