As an old and seasoned geek, I've accumulated my fair share of outdated technology over the years. You know the stuff: old laptops, giant mobile phones and thousands of ethernet cables and kettle plugs. 

Given the fact that I've moved 25 times in 21 years, you'd think that I'd have jettisoned more of this stuff along the way.  But in my last few moves, I was so sick of sorting and packing, that it all ended up coming with me.

Two years ago I moved into my countryside home, the cruft found a cupboard, and has been there since.  New Years 2012 is only 24 hours  away and I'm determined to be shut of this clutter by then.  

Help me to free my life of this stuff, while providing yourself with opportunities to upcycle some of this stuff into cool hack projects.  Let's keep as much of this copper  out of the landfill as possible. 

Please help me to find homes for the following:
