Regular visitors to omphe.com will notice that we've undergone a major overhaul of the site.  All of the professional information pertaining to freelance web design and development has been shelved and will soon be updated on the parent site: <a href="http://www.clockworkrobot.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.clockworkrobot.co.uk</a>.  Similarly, expect to see the photo content finding a new home on <a href="http://www.faulls.com">faulls.com</a> in the near future.

Omphe.com is undergoing this big change just prior to the Clockwork Robot team attends <a href="http://paris2009.drupalcon.org/" target="_blank">DrupalCon 2009</a> in Paris.  The convention promises to provide plenty of information and inspiration around the <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> content management system and this new site will start its life by acting as a journal of the event itself.

In coming months, watch for updates to news and tutorials here at omphe.com to support the web development community.
