![DrupalCon Paris 2009 - Refreshment Tokens](/assets/images/DrupalConBeer.jpg)

They say that, "There's no such thing as a free lunch", but judging by the refreshment tokens in the DrupalCon goodie bag, __they__ would be wrong.

The presence of beer tokens in the selection not only shows the great community spirit of the Drupal community and the conference organisers, but proves that Drupal is _free as in Open Source_ and _free as in beer_.
