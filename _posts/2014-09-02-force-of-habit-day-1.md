Things are already starting to change.  I just ran out to my workshop because I had forgotten to tin my soldering iron before I locked up for the night.

After this morning's epic post, I'm all out of writing juice, and nearly out of day.  But day one has been a lot of fun. Writing, sketching and then an epic session getting started with the 3D printer build.

Here's a quick timelapse of the pre-assembly build.  A wee bit of soldering, and some cool welding of M3 and M5 hardware into the printed parts. It's shot from above, so you won't be able to spot the big grin on my face.
